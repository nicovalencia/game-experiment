# game-experiment

Just a place for me to scratch in some Javascript game ideas. Will eventually translate to Java for Android native app, and maybe iOS someday if I have time (or help).

### Milestones

 - Character Sprites
 - Accellerometer based movement
 - Collision detection
 - Map design
 - Map seeding
 - Dialogs and Interactions Interface
